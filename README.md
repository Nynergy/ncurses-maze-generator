# NCurses Maze Generator
---------------------------------------

A simple maze generator implemented with the recursive backtracking algorithm in ncurses (C++).

This little project was inspired by my desire to make a dungeon generator, and making mazes seemed like a good place to start. The code was largely taken from this tutorial (https://youtube.com/watch?v=Y37-gB83HKE) by javidx9 (OneLoneCoder) on YouTube. He implemented a very similar maze generator in his own console game engine, and I decided to recreate it in the terminal with ncurses.

## Dependencies

You will need to have ncurses installed on your machine. You can find out how to install it for your specific machine by looking online.
